# 💌 Wedding Card Generator

A simple, lightweight tool that helps you write heartfelt wedding thank-you cards without losing your mind (or your handwriting).

I wrote all of *my* wedding cards by hand — don’t worry, I didn’t cheat — but somewhere around card number forty-something I realized:
**“Wow. I’m kind of mad this tool doesn’t exist.”**
So… I built it.

This little web app makes the process a lot faster (and honestly, more fun).

## ✨ Features

* Add guest names + couple names
* Click “chips” to build a personalized message
* Add your own custom lines
* Shuffle a card instantly
* “Write my card 🪄” generates a full, natural-sounding thank-you note
* “Make this flow ✍️” cleans up the sentences so it reads smoothly
* Fully editable preview
* One-click copy
* Responsive layout
* Optional ad placements
* Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no dependencies

## 🎯 Why this exists

Because writing 70+ thank-you cards hits differently when your wrist is already destroyed from signing documents for wedding vendors.

This tool makes it easier for:

* Couples writing batches of cards
* People who freeze when they have to “say something nice”
* Anyone who wants messages that sound real, not corporate or copy-paste cheesy
